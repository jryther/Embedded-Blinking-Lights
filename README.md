# Embedded-Blinking-Lights

Overview:

In this lab, you will use TI Code Composer Studio (CCS) to program the TC CC3220x LAUNCHXL to blink some LEDs. Blinking LEDs in the embedded space is equivalent to “Hello, world!” in the desktop space.

During this milestone you will use CCS to edit, compile, and load code into the CC32xx board. You will then proceed to use it for debugging. Throughout this process, you explore the components of a CCS project and the CCS code generator (system config). You will also be able to learn more about the PWM driver.

Goal: Your objective is to blink the green and yellow LEDs on the board.
